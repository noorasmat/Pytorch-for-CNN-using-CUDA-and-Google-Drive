# Pytorch-for-CNN-using-CUDA-and-Google-Drive
This repository contains code for CNN using Pytorch. The code uses Mnist Digit dataset that is commonly available and an open and publicaly available dataset. The model uses GPU, CUDA from Google colab. For dataset uploading, google drive folder is used. 
Some of the code in this repository is taken from https://www.kaggle.com/jiazhuang/cnn-with-pytorch-for-beginners/notebook but adds some additional features as we mentioned earlier.
